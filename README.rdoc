<tt>API Request example query</tt>
  
<http://localhost:3000/search?first_name=Brant&last_name=Nienow&ip_address=8.8.8.8>

<tt>This app uses geocoder library to geocode ip address.</tt>

<tt>It currently doesn't handle timeout and assumes people's names to be unique. 
If NSA API returns multiple people with same first and last name then it considers only the last person.</tt>
